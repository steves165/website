                            <p>
                            	I am currently studying for my final year at university and I am seeking a career in Computer Science or IT. I have a considerable knowledge of Computer Hardware, Web Development and Software Engineering. Equally so, I have experience in technical support from sorting out friends and families systems. In my free time I am a volunteer skilled instructor in the scouting association and have an enhanced CRB for them. I have worked for Sainsbury's as a Butcher and Fishmonger for over 5 years in a part time capacity and this has given me a great deal of customer service experience.
