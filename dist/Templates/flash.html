							 <p class=""> For years before I went to university I loved to play around with flash, at first I only had a copy of macromedia flash but I eventually got a copy of cs3 (which I still use now, in fact I am writting this in DreamWeaver cs3). As part of A-level we got the chance to create a website in flash I spent ages doing it and I got an A :). However as soon as I went to university I realised that no one really uses flash that much in the real world and that all the major webs apps are written in languages like PHP, JavaScript, Ruby, etc. However I thought that since I had already made these I would put them up anyway!! :) So Enjoy Them!! :)  </p>
                        <p class="">
                        This is a simple Webcam Viewer made in flash, it requires flash player to be active on your browser and it requires you to accept the permissions in order to make it work.

                     	<p class=""> This is a simple colour's game that I made for my baby brother (please do excuse the voice, yes that is me speaking into my rubbish microphone!!). The game would normally be made using the onRelease mouse function, but that didnt give me all of the functionality that I wanted so I used hittesting instead!! :) </p>
