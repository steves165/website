<strong>Welcome to my Website</strong>
<p>Hello my name is Stephen Skidmore, I am 22 years old and I work for Virgin Holidays as a Web Developer. Also I studied Computer Science BSc Hons at the University of Surrey. <br/> <br/>I have made this website because I want to help other people doing similar courses to me to get a grasp on some of the basics of web application development. The website will contain any JavaScript or other web application projects I decide to try, as I am currently looking for a job in this sector so as I am getting practice there will most likely be a lot on this site. <br/> <br/>I have accrued a great deal of experience in Javascript, JQuery, ActionScript 2.0, 3.0 as well as a number of others. Also the astute among you may have noticed I use JS files as I think that internal Scripting of any kind is pointless. While I do know a number of programming languages such as Java and C++, I will not be putting them upon this site as this is only for web apps. So you can expect JavaScript, Flash (actionscript), and PHP on this site. <br /><br /></p>
