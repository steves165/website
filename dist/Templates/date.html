								Current Date Project

                   			<p> Welcome to my first ever JavaScript Project. I got the idea for this project from one of my lectures at university, our lecturer said about how you can make the current date appear and I wanted to test out the innerHTML  function I had just discovered which allows you to change the content of a P tag dyanmically. It took me a while to get the reset button to work however and it was quite a strange thing to pick as my first project but it all works now!! :) :P</p>
